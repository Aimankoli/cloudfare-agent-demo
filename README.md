### Motivatiom

This is a simple application that reviews code, dynamically learns from your coding habbits, and gives live suggestions. I build this tool because as a student, we tend to rely a lot on AI tools to code our projects and assignments without really understanding what is going on. I wanted the perfect balance between coding an assignment myself, but also having a mentor by my side to review my code and guide me through the project rather than completing it.
